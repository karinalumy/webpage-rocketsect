In this project I could learn more about HTML ans CSS.</br>
This was the advanced challenge of the begginer stage in the Rocketseat course and I had so much fun doing it.</br>

**What I've learned?**
* Create unordered and ordered lists "ul and ol"
* Change the coursor  ":hover"
* Use the display flex
* Use the position fixed (in the padlock image)
* Import the images in svg
* Import other fonts
